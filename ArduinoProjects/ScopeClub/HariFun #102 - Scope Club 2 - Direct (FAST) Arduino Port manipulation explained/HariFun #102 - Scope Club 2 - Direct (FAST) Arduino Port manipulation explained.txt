HariFun #102 - Scope Club 2 - Direct (FAST) Arduino Port manipulation explained

PORTD
D0..D7
7654 3210
7654 32xx -- NEVER set lowest bit as output or you cant receive data

PORTB
D8..D13
XXDC BA98 -- High two bits are occupied by the crystal

PORTC
A0..A5
xx54 3210 -- High two bits are only available on Arduino Mini

So, I chose to use the low six bits of PORTB and PORTC.
To set the port directions (PinMode) of the low six bits as output
and not touch the high two bits, we use a bit OR.

DDRB = DDRB | B00111111; // Set bottom 6 bits as outout while leaving the top two alone
DDRC = DDRC | B00111111; // Set bottom 6 bits as outout while leaving the top two alone

To set the value of the port without affecting the high two bits, we first clear all bits except those:
PORTB = PORTB & B11000000;

Then we clear the two bits of the source value (just in case)
val = val & B00111111;

Finally, we combine those two operations:
PORTB = (PORTB & B11000000) | (val & B00111111);
